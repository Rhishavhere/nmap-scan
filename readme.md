***Network Scanner For Hosts & Ports***

## Overview
This project provides a set of PowerShell scripts for network analysis and security scanning. The tools are designed to help system administrators quickly assess network status.

## Key Features
- **Host Discovery**: Identify active devices on a network
- **Port Scanning**: Detect open ports and services
- **Multiple Scanning Techniques**: Supports various network protocols and methods

## Technologies Used
1. **Bash Shell**: Scripting for Linux/Unix environments
2. **Git Bash** : Used to run the script on windows 
2. **Nmap**: Powerful network scanning tool
3. **ICMP/ARP Protocols**: Used for network device discovery
4. **TCP/IP**: Core networking protocols for communication

## Scanning Methods
- **Ping Sweep**: Basic host discovery using ICMP
- **Nmap Scans**: Advanced scanning including:
  - ARP discovery
  - ICMP echo
  - OS detection
  - Service version detection

## Purpose
These tools help in:
- Network inventory management
- Security auditing
- Troubleshooting network issues
- Identifying unauthorized devices
- Detecting open ports and potential vulnerabilities

## Usage
Run the scripts in Bash environment with Nmap installed. Results are saved in text files for further analysis.
